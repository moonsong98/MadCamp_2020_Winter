# MadCamp_2020_Winter
Projects from Week 1 to Week 4

### Week1
We created Android App using Android Studio with Kotlin. Requirements were three tabs, which are contact tab, gallery tab, and any tab we want to make. \ 
Our Project made an Restaurant Review App. \
Contact tab contained restaurant contacts, so users could easily contact to restaurants. \
Gallery tab contained restaurant reviews with pictures and reviews. \
We chose to make restaurant map for the last tab. We used map api to locate restaurants in a map. When restaurant is chosen in the map, users could find their previous reviews that are written for the restaurant before.
